      <h1>Setup</h1>
      <p>
        Before getting started on the animation or anything of the sort, I would gather a bunch of data on a relevant topic for the
        visualization. I would make sure that the data is accurate. Afterwards, I would plan the data
        visualization out and its basic design. Then, I would make the data visualization, including the legend that will represent the music
        genres. After making the data visualization on the webpage, and making sure that it is to scale and uses updated and flexible
        methods, which I should be doing throughout the whole creation process, I will move on to the animation process.

      <h1>Animation</h1>
      <p>
        The animations in this visualization are really complex to do. If I were to make that work with D3, I would use paths in SVG.
        Paths would make the lines or curves that are made in the animation, that run from button to button. Then, I would slowly reveal
        the rest of the visualization using the CSS attribute 'display.' This will make the user feel as if the visualization is being
        animated right before him/her.

      <h1>Interactivity</h1>
      <p>
        The interaction in the visualization would be handled by binding event listeners to each button in the data visualization. The
        hovering effect and clicking would both be handled by the .on() event, and this would run a function that either plays the sound,
        or makes the rest of the buttons a darker shade while allowing the one that the mouse is currently hovering over to be brighter.
